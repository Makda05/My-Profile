I am from a country on the east side of Africa called Ethiopia, I grew up in Kenya though, till the age of 15.That is when I moved to the beautiful city in America called El Paso, Texas, after 9 years in El Paso I moved to Seattle and was fortunate to come across information about the year up program.

Currently I am a student at the yearup program,the year up program is a technical training and development program with 250 corporate partners,4000 students graduating anually across 19 cities .

The things that excite me about the program managment is being able to use the knowledge that i have from life and the knowledge i will gain paired up with the lessons that I ve learned from the program and be able to apply it to a project that can cause change even just if its for a small community of people or just one person.



I have been able to complete the online certification for project managment
